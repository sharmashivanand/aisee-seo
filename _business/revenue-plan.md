## Executive summary

- Concept: AISee SEO augments existing SEO plugins by pulling Google Search Console (GSC) performance data into the post editor, generating keyword-driven taxonomies, tag clouds, internal-link recommendations, and “See Also” related posts.
- Model: Free WordPress plugin + hosted companion service that brokers GSC auth and returns per-URL keyword metrics.
- Feasibility (12 months): Viable as a complementary SEO/insights tool with a freemium-to-pro path—if you modernize compatibility, tighten privacy/compliance around GSC data, and sharpen the positioning around internal linking and keyword intelligence. Competitive landscape is crowded but there’s a niche for “GSC-powered internal linking/keyword workflow” that can coexist with Yoast/Rank Math/etc.
- Investment level: Moderate. Expect 2–3 months of engineering to modernize + shore up the service, then ongoing maintenance. Marketing will drive outcomes more than features after month 6.
- Go/No-Go: Go, with a focus on “GSC insights → internal linking and content refresh workflow” and a PRO plan priced for agencies/power users.

Assumptions used:
- WordPress core versions ~6.5–6.6 are target (plugin currently advertises Tested up to: 5.1).
- You control and can update the companion service at aiseeseo.com and its Google API project.
- You intend to list/re-list on wp.org for distribution.

## What the plugin is today

- Core features from code
  - GSC insights in post editor: fetches clicks, impressions, CTR, position per query for the post URL via your service endpoint (AISEEAPIEPSL).
  - Keyword filters and tagging: saves keywords to post meta; filters by CTR/position/clicks/impressions; populates two custom taxonomies:
    - aisee_term: entire phrases from GSC.
    - aisee_tag: exploded single-word tags from those phrases (minus stop-words).
  - Internal link recommendations in admin list view: uses overlap between tags and Levenshtein scoring on taxonomy terms to suggest posts to link to.
  - “See Also” related posts on front-end: appends a related list using a Levenshtein-based similarity of aisee_term terms; cached via transient for 15 days.
  - Tag cloud: requests the fully rendered HTML of the published post, strips scripts/styles, parses text to create a weighted tag cloud (more realistic keyword landscape than content-only analysis).
  - Weekly cron + WP-CLI: batch-generates taxonomies site-wide; CLI command wp aisee regenerate.
  - Dashboard widget: AISee terms and tags cloud admin widget.

- Architecture highlights
  - WordPress plugin with central `AISee` class; feature modules in includes (gsc.php, tagcloud.php, tagcomplete.php, cli.php).
  - Remote GSC brokering via `https://aiseeseo.com/?p=9` with state/nonce; uses `wp_safe_remote_request`.
  - Caching: simple per-post 7-day cache for keyword meta; 15-day transients for related posts.
  - Taxonomies are public and REST-enabled (aisee_term, aisee_tag).

- Current maturity/signals
  - Readme indicates “Tested up to: 5.1”, “Requires at least: 3.7.4”. That’s materially outdated for today’s WP (6.x).
  - Version 2.2 in header; MIT licensed.
  - UI uses jQuery/jQuery UI sliders in admin; sortable table; basic CSS branding.
  - Some inconsistencies (UI states say 15 days refresh; code uses 7 days for refetch logic).

## Code quality and maintainability (high-level)

- Strengths
  - Clear separation: main plugin bootstrap + feature modules.
  - WordPress-native patterns: actions/filters, AJAX nonces, `wp_safe_remote_request`, custom taxonomies, cron, WP-CLI.
  - Minimal dependencies; no build step required.
  - Data encoded with base64 + JSON for state passing; basic sanitization used.

- Risks/tech debt
  - Compatibility: “Tested up to 5.1” suggests no recent QA on 6.x; Gutenberg/editor integrations are absent; classic metabox UI only.
  - Remote service contract: hardcoded endpoint query string (`?p=9`) and loosely specified JSON contract; brittle if service changes; no explicit versioning.
  - Security/privacy:
    - Sends site URL, return link, and admin-ajax URL in encoded state to the service; ensure TLS-only and remove unnecessary data. Confirm you don’t expose admin URLs or nonce verification weaknesses.
    - Logging to log.log in plugin directory can grow unbounded; could leak data on shared hosting.
  - Performance:
    - Related posts compute Levenshtein across many terms and posts; for large sites, it may be expensive (mitigated by 15-day caching but still a risk).
    - Weekly cron batch generating taxonomies across all posts may be heavy for big sites/time-limited hosts.
  - UX polish:
    - Admin metaboxes are old-school; no React/Gutenberg block.
    - Tag complete uses Google Suggest (jsonp) and tries to enqueue remote jQuery UI—overrides WP-bundled scripts (not ideal).
  - Code quality:
    - Duplicate stop-words arrays in multiple files.
    - Some sanitize/escape gaps in HTML output and JS templating (most key areas use `wp_kses`—good—but review is needed).
    - Magic numbers (slider ranges, term limits) with minimal docs.

- Quick wins
  - Update compatibility: test and bump “Tested up to” to 6.x; fix deprecated hooks if any.
  - Replace remote jQuery UI with WP-bundled; stop overriding/deregistering core scripts.
  - Add feature flags/settings to disable front-end “See Also” if not desired.
  - Hardening: consistent escaping, remove admin URLs from remote state, document data flow and retention, log rotation/off switch.
  - Version your API between plugin and service. Add health check.

## Market and competition

- Market size and dynamics
  - WordPress powers ~43% of the web; SEO plugins are among the most installed categories.
  - GSC is universally relevant; most site owners underutilize it or struggle to convert insights to actions. This plugin’s niche is translating GSC data into tangible on-page actions (tags, links, refreshes).
- Competitors and overlaps
  - Yoast SEO, Rank Math, All in One SEO, SEOPress: dominant general-purpose SEO plugins focusing on metadata, sitemaps, content scoring. Some offer content AI or internal link suggestions, but few directly operationalize per-URL GSC query data inside the editor.
  - Niche tools: Link Whisper (internal linking), SurferSEO/Clearscope/MktMuse (content optimization), Keysearch/Ahrefs/SEMrush (keyword research), and assorted “Related Posts” plugins.
- Positioning opportunity
  - Complement, don’t replace: “Use AISee with your main SEO plugin to turn your live GSC data into better internal links, focused content, and faster refreshes.”
  - Clear differentiators:
    - Per-URL GSC keywords inline in editor (actionable filters).
    - Auto taxonomy/tagging that powers internal linking and related posts.
    - Tag cloud from fully rendered HTML (not content-only), reflecting real keyword landscape.

## Monetization and pricing

- Freemium split
  - Free:
    - Basic GSC connection (limited timeframe or quotas).
    - Tag cloud.
    - Limited keyword table (e.g., top 10 queries) and one-click add term/tag.
    - Basic related posts injection (with setting toggle).
  - Pro/Subscription:
    - Unlimited GSC keyword rows, longer lookbacks, historical comparisons.
    - Sitewide internal link suggestions with bulk apply in editor/list screens.
    - Automation: weekly keyword refresh + taxonomy refresh; broken link detection within suggestions.
    - Multi-site and role-based permissions.
    - CSV export, GA4/GSC blend, content refresh alerts.
    - Priority support and SLA.

- Pricing suggestions (start simple; iterate)
  - Solo/Pro: $9–$12/month per site.
  - Agency: $39–$59/month up to 10 sites; $99/month up to 30 sites.
  - Annual 2 months free; launch discount for early adopters.
  - Limit a fair-use quota for API calls (GSC fetches) to control cost.

- Other monetization
  - One-time PRO license with yearly updates (lower LTV).
  - Services upsell: keyword refresh projects, internal linking audits.
  - Enterprise custom install of the broker (self-hosted option).

## Costs and effort (12-month estimate)

- Engineering
  - Initial hardening/modernization (Q1): 8–12 weeks (1 experienced WP engineer).
  - Ongoing maintenance: ~0.3–0.5 FTE for updates/support/bugfixes.
- Backend/API (GSC broker service)
  - GCP project with Search Console API.
  - Serverless or small VM + caching layer. Cost likely modest at early scale (sub-$100/month) but plan for quota handling and retries.
  - Security work: OAuth flows, token handling, minimal data retention.
- Support
  - Email/ticket support: ~0.2 FTE to start; scale with installs.
- Marketing
  - Content + docs + site: $2–5k initial for assets or 2–4 weeks in-house.
  - Ads/launch campaigns optional: $500–$2k/month to test.

Illustrative 12-month budget (USD; adjust to your rates):
- Dev initial: $25k–$45k
- Ongoing dev: $12k–$24k
- Infra & tools: $1k–$3k
- Support: $6k–$12k
- Marketing/content: $6k–$20k
Total: ~$50k–$100k

## Revenue projections and KPIs

- Funnel assumptions (illustrative)
  - wp.org listing + content marketing yields 1,000–3,000 free active installs in 12 months.
  - 4–8% connect GSC successfully; 1.5–3.0% convert to paid (over rolling 90 days).
- Scenarios (ARR by month 12)
  - Conservative: 1,000 free → 5% GSC connect → 1.5% paid on free base = 15 paid seats
    - ARPU $10 → MRR ~$150; ARR ~$1.8k (needs more growth/marketing)
  - Base case: 2,000 free → 6% connect → 2.5% paid = 50 paid
    - MRR ~$500; ARR ~$6k (still small; focus on agencies/multi-site to lift ARPU)
  - Optimistic: 3,000 free → 8% connect → 3% paid = 90 paid
    - MRR ~$900; ARR ~$10.8k
- KPI to track
  - Active installs, DAU/WAU of the plugin.
  - GSC connect success rate; % of posts with keywords pulled.
  - “Populate taxonomy” and “Add tag” actions; internal link insertions per session.
  - Paid conversion rate; churn; ARPU; time-to-value (first keyword table seen).
  - Error rates from API service; OAuth drop-off.

Takeaway: Direct-to-user small-site monetization is slow; prioritize an agency plan and features that make bulk internal linking and content refresh easy at scale (boost ARPU and conversion).

## Risks and mitigations

- Google API/ToS and quotas
  - Risk: API policy changes; quota caps; caching/storage limits.
  - Mitigation: Minimize storage of GSC data, document retention; apply for higher quotas; add backoff/retry; allow user-owned GCP client option (advanced).
- WordPress compatibility drift
  - Risk: Breaking changes and editor updates.
  - Mitigation: Regular 6.x compatibility testing; Gutenberg block or sidebar panel; CI on major WP/PHP versions.
- Performance on large sites
  - Risk: Batch taxonomy and Levenshtein similarity blow up.
  - Mitigation: Index and precompute; background processing; cap post counts; paginate; async/offload heavy ops.
- Privacy/compliance
  - Risk: Sending site/admin URLs in state; logs with sensitive data.
  - Mitigation: Minimize state; encrypt state server-side; disable file logging by default; add privacy policy and DPA.
- Competition feature creep
  - Risk: Big SEO plugins launch similar features.
  - Mitigation: Double down on internal linking workflow + agency tooling; integrations; speed and UX.

---

## 12-month roadmap (by quarter)

- Q1: Foundation and compliance
  - Update compatibility to WP 6.x; bump headers and test across PHP 7.4–8.2.
  - API contract v1: versioned endpoints; remove admin URLs from state; document data retention.
  - Hardening: escape/sanitize pass; logging off by default; settings toggle for “See Also.”
  - Onboarding polish: wizard to connect GSC with better error handling; empty-state UI.
  - Release 2.3 on wp.org; refresh readme, screenshots, and tags.

- Q2: Product differentiation
  - Internal linking assistant v1: suggestions within the editor with “insert link” action and rationale.
  - Batch/automation: scheduled keyword refresh and taxonomy updates with progress UI; sitewide dry run.
  - Gutenberg panel for GSC keywords and filters; block for Tag Cloud.
  - Settings to scope which post types are included; performance guardrails.

- Q3: Monetization and agency features
  - PRO launch: unlimited rows/history; bulk apply suggestions; CSV export; multi-site seat management.
  - Per-site and agency billing; license or SaaS subscription with usage limits.
  - Analytics: per-post “refresh opportunities” report (queries with high impressions/low CTR).
  - Integrations: GA4 basic metrics enrichment (optional).

- Q4: Scale and partnerships
  - Refinement via user feedback; optimize API costs.
  - Content marketing engine: case studies, tutorials, and comparison pages.
  - Partnerships with SEO agencies and hosting providers.

---

## Actionable improvements (low-risk quick wins)

- Add a Settings page: toggle “See Also” output; related posts count; cron controls.
- Replace remote jQuery UI with WP-bundled scripts; remove dequeue/enqueue anti-patterns.
- Consolidate stop-words in one helper with filter hook; reuse across modules.
- Refactor related posts:
  - Limit candidate pool (recent/top posts); cap comparisons; pre-index terms; consider cosine similarity on vectors instead of Levenshtein per pair.
- Logging: off by default; add size limit/rotation; respect WP_DEBUG.

---

## Final recommendation

- Proceed (Go), with a clear niche: “Use your real GSC data to build better internal linking and content refresh workflows inside WordPress.”
- Focus first 90 days on modernization, UX, and reliability of the GSC broker. Then lean into internal linking automation and agency-scale features to drive revenue.
- Keep it complementary to the big SEO plugins, not competitive with them.
