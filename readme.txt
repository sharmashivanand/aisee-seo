Keyword research and insights for SEOs. Get performance data from Google Search Console. Visalize content as a tag cloud.

== Description ==
Everyone is using the same SEO plugins. We believe SEO is not a plugin but a process. That's where AISee comes in.

AISee gives you the data that you can use to optimize your post content. Yep, some smart human-intervention can give you a cutting edge over your competitors who use the best SEO plugins but set 'em up and forget it… yep that doesn't last long.

* __Get Performance Data from Google Search Console:__ This feature requires a one click free registration with [AISee Service](https://aiseeseo.com/) so that it can serve you your data from Google Search Console.

* __Visualize your entire post as a tag cloud:__ We built this feature because we know other plugins didn't cut it for us. They just analyze the post-content. But AISee fetches your entire URL as it appears to the search bots and visitors. Really! And that's how you can see an accurate keyword-landscape of your post content.

Do you ever wonder how your keyword landscape looks like? Clusters of jibberish crawled by search spiders, churned through so many algorithms… What are the prominent keywords in your content **mind you not just the post content**. Your theme, plugins, scripts, post title… there's a lot that comes into play while rendering the markup for search bots.

The key is to get the search densitiy right so that the post content stays on topic rather than getting lost around tons and tons of meaning less words.

NOTICE: The Google Search Console feature requires a connection to [AISee](https://aiseeseo.com/). This requires setting up a free account with a single click and authorizing AISee with Google Search Console.

#### Google Search Console Performance-Data:
You can fetch performance data inline with the post editor to see optimization insights.
#### LSI Keywords:
With AISee you can also visualize the LSI keywords.
